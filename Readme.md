# 🧠 Memory Journey

**Memory Journey** is an interactive website designed to explore and practice core concepts of memory from AP Psychology.  
It combines mini-games, visual aids, and study tools to help users better understand encoding, storage, and retrieval strategies.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a **final project** for **AP Psych Cyber** with **Dr. Jones**.  
It aims to make memory concepts engaging through hands-on practice and short, accessible explanations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Home Dashboard**
  - Tracks your saved chunks, rooms, flashcards, and links.
  - Quick start button to jump into learning.

- **Chunking Challenge**
  - Practice breaking down long strings (e.g., numbers) into meaningful groups.

- **Memory Palace 🏰**
  - Build and save your own “rooms” for spatial encoding practice.

- **Flashcards (Spaced Repetition)**
  - Create question/answer pairs and cycle through them.
  - Flip, delete, and navigate cards interactively.

- **Elaborative Linking 🔗**
  - Associate key terms with random emojis to strengthen dual-coded memory traces.
  - Includes a pop-up explainer about why elaborative encoding works.

- **Memory Diagram**
  - Step-by-step visual journey of how a new memory forms.
  - Annotated with relevant brain regions.

- **Info Pages**
  - Short AP Psych explainers on chunking, memory palace, elaborative encoding, and the spacing effect.

## 🖥️ How to Run Locally

1. Download the project files (you only need `Psych project.html`).
2. Double-click the file, or right-click and choose **Open With → Your Browser**.
3. That’s it! The site runs completely in your browser — no extra setup required.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Notes (for the curious)

- Built as a **single HTML file** with inline JavaScript and TailwindCSS via CDN.
- Uses **hash-based routing** (`#home`, `#learn`, etc.) to switch between sections.
- Saves user progress (chunks, rooms, cards, and links) in **localStorage**.
- Designed for easy portability — just one file you can run anywhere.
